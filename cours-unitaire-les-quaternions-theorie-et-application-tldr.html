	  <h3>Quaternions de rotations</h3> 
L'espace des quaternions est un espace à quatre dimensions. Seuls les quaternions dontla norme vaut un peuvent être des rotations. Cette condition est nécesaire pour qu'un quaternion puisse être une rotation.  
</p>
<p>
Un quaternions est écrit : 
$$
q = a +bi+cj+dk \, \, \text{où} \, \, (a,b,c,d) \in \mathbb{R}
$$

</p>
<p>
On a les relations suivantes  
$$
i^2= j^2=k^2=ijk= -1
$$
De plus:  
$$
ij = k ; jk = i ; ki = j
$$
Pour $p$ et $q$ deux quaternions, le produit est anti-comutatif, la formule est très explicite : 
$$
p \times q = - q \times p
$$
</p>
<p>
Norme d'un quaternion :
	$$
	\parallel q \parallel = \sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}+d^{2}}
	$$

	  Cette page web ne se veut pas comme être la référence théorique sur les quaternions. Son objectif est uniquement de permettre de les appréhender d'un point de vue appliqué pour permettre leur utilisation en programmation 3D. La théorie des quaternions est vaste et touche diverses domaines des mathématiques, de l'algèbre linéaire, bilinéaire, sesquilinéaire, algèbre pur, Analyse complexe.
